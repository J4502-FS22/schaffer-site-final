      <h1>7 Outdoor Recreation Spots Around Columbia</h1>
      <p>At first, Columbia, located smack dab in the middle of Missouri, might seem like a pretty unassuming college town. When I first moved out here, I felt trapped by its relatively small size. Then, I discovered just how awesome its central location is in terms of outdoor recreation. Here are some of my favorite spots that have helped me come to love the area.</p>
