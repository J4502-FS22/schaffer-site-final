      <div>
        <p>What is that free, loose feeling that comes with being in nature that we simply canâ€™t describe with words alone? Check out these seven pieces of entertainment, from books to comics, to get into the outdoorsy spirit and embrace that childlike feeling from playing outside.</p>

          <h2>Long Lost</h2>
          <p>Album by Lord Huron</p>
          <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5xiePX6kXj5ZsmUsqIqzeD?si=07pClTUcQ92AUrRy0g9r5w">Listen to Long Lost on Spotify</a></p>
          <p>For their fourth studio album, indie-folk-rock band Lord Huron creates an eerie, nostalgic sound that is perfect for a chilly, cloudy hike in the woods. Just remember that if you do choose to listen to music while enjoying the outdoors, wear headphones! Do not create sound pollution that can disturb wildlife by playing music from a loud speaker.</p>

          <p>This perkier listening option will get you in the mood to grab a friend by the hand, run to the nearest Irish pub, and dance to the sound of live fiddles. Like Lord Huron, The Oh Hellos fall into the indie-folk-rock genre, but they invoke a completely different feeling with their energetic instruments and natural-sounding backup vocals.</p>
