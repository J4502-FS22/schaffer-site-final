      <h1>Where Columbia's Recycling Ends Up</h1>
      <p>Recycling efforts are increasingly being hampered by contamination that has risen, according to Columbia Recovery Superintendent Nicholas Paul. On a photography assignment for the <a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/city-recycling-services-fall-short-of-potential/article_ad26d13e-5492-11ed-9f9a-dbcadd22b257.html"> Columbia Missourian</a> newspaper, I took a trip to Columbia's main recycling facility, just a 15-minute-long drive from my downtown apartment, to illustrate the issue. Here is what I saw.</p>

        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_2.jpg" alt="Colorful and dirty aluminum cans are compacted into a block.">
        <figcaption>Compacted aluminum cans pile up in one corner of the facility. Aluminum is often non-recyclable due to a non-metal coating meant to preserve food.</figcaption>

      <figure class="gallery-image">
        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_3.jpg" alt="Surrounded by dirty machinery, a male worker in a neon green vest points upwards to communicate with his coworkers.">
        <figcaption>Over the loud noise of machinery operating, facility workers like Dan Wisselman, above, must communicate with their coworkers using gestures.</figcaption>

      <figure class="gallery-image">
        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_4.jpg" alt="A man in a neon green vest guides masses of paper waste onto a verticle conveyor belt. The waste appears to be pouring down on him.">
        <figcaption>Worker Ryan James guides masses of cardboard and paper waste onto a conveyor belt. Cardboard cannot be recycled if it has been contaminated with food, and 45% of the waste coming into the facility is contaminated.</figcaption>

      <figure class="gallery-image">
        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_5.jpg" alt="Bales of messy, shredded paper stack up to a building's metal ceiling.">
        <figcaption>The facility ships bales of shredded, paper-based materials to other recycling facilities around the world.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="gallery-image">
        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_6.jpg" alt="A woman in a neon green vest walks around large black bins of waste on a thin, metal walkway.">
        <figcaption>If sorters like Tamia Robinson, pictured above, find unwanted trash from an identifiable source, it gets reported and the people responsible get fined..</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="gallery-image">
        <img src="recycling-images/recycling_7.jpg" alt="A ragedy American flag pokes out of a bale of waste.">
        <figcaption>The Columbia recycling facility gets stuck sorting out everything from American flags to medical needles to baby dolls.</figcaption>
